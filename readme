UNIX SIMPLE SHELL
CREATED BY: SEIF ASHRAF



How to use the shell?
---------------------
1- open your terminal and run "make"
2- run "./myshell"
3- Start typing commands 


Issues:
-------
* DON'T include (" ") using the grep command. Ex. ps -ef | grep "127" (WILL NOT WORK).
* The shell has a buffer maximum length of 1024 bytes so make sure you abide by that limit and don't try to cat a file
	or execute any command that may use those buffers exceeding their limit to avoid buffer overflows.
